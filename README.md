### XDY - Code Busker

* Developer, mostly backend.
* Nerd, mostly rpg:s.

When the items in the above list interact, some kind of nerdish software may be created or extended.
Lately that's been mostly:
* https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt
* https://github.com/xdy/foundryvtt-lang-sv

But I've also added - and subtracted :) - bugs and features in at least the following projects:
* https://github.com/xdy-forks/TravellerTools
* https://github.com/xdy-forks/maptool
* https://github.com/xdy-forks/HL_DD_5e_Colab
* https://github.com/xdy-forks/pcgen-base

I've even done something non-software-related:
* https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/286145/Setting-Rule-Veritas

If you've enjoyed something I've created:
* [![ko-fi](https://www.ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/L3L027AXX)

If you've *not* enjoyed something I've created:
* No coffee for me. Bad xdy. :(
